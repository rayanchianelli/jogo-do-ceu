KNOCKING ON THE HEAVEN'S DOOR

This is a simple game in which the player must guess the password to enter heaven, and has three chances to play.

How to play

Run the code in a Python interpreter.
Read the tip provided by St. Peter.
Enter the password that you believe is correct.
Depending on your answer, St. Peter can either welcome you to heaven or send you to hell.
If you don't get the password right on the first try, you can try again or exit the game.

How it works

The game is written in Python and uses the random module to generate a random number that selects a password from the Saint Peter's list of passwords.
The player types in their answer and is checked to see if it is correct.
If the player doesn't get the password right on the first try, a new try is allowed.
After two tries, the player is given the option to play again or quit the game.
